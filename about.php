        <p>This is a site about nothing really. No, not <em>that</em> nothing! Sheesh.</p>
        <p>It's mostly here to see if I can do something. Does that make sense? It's a work in progress.</p>

        <p>I am but a simple human. Looking to explore and grow my learning of different things in the tech community.</p>
        <p>There's not much else to me, that is all I am, and I enjoy it.</p>
        <p>I know this isn't much of an about page, and that's okay.</p>

        <p>Who doesn't enjoy a good story?</p>
        <p>That's what this website could be about, one story per day. Yes that's exactly what it could be.</p>
