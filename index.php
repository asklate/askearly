    <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
    <p>This website is coming soon.</p>
    <p>You know how they say something is coming soon and it never shows up? Yeah that could be this site, you just never know.</p>
    <p>It would be nice to be able to figure out exactly what I want to put here, but I'm not sure.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column">
    <p>But what would I know exactly how this all works? I haven't developed a website in ages.</p>
    <p>I mean not for myself of course. Sure I've done websites for other people, but not for myself in a while.</p>
    <p>Eventually I'll figure out what to put here, but until then you get to see all of this...whatever this is!</p>
    <p>Will it ever come to fruition? I do not know. Haven't a clue what will happen...it could be something quite different.</p>

    <h2>Sometimes You Just Want To Write</h2>
    <p>That's right, sometimes you just want to write. You don't want to care about the flow of things, how they turn out on a screen etc.</p>
    <p>You just want to write and allow your feelings to flow.</p>
    <p>If you can't have that, what are you even doing writing?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
    <p>There are other times when you want to design whatever it is you're writing. Have full control of the process. I enjoy those times as well. They give meaning and purpose.</p>
    <p>Having a meaning and purpose is a wonderful thing. It's an important thing to have in life. At least I believe that's the case. Who knows what other people believe, but that's what I believe.</p>
    <p>Who knows how this website will end up. I don't. You don't. We just don't know yet.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
    <p>By we, I mean I... because I rarely know what's going on with any of it. Let's face the facts here okay? I just don't know where this website will lead. It could lead to great things, it could lead to not great things... who knows.</p>
